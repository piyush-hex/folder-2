    <h1>Chapter 2 – Number System & Conversion Boolean Logic</h1>
    <p>The number system is a fundamental concept in computer science, representing data in various formats, such as binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal. The binary system, which uses only two digits (0 and 1), is the foundation of all computer operations, as it aligns with the on/off states of electronic circuits. Conversion between these number systems is essential for understanding how data is processed and manipulated within a computer. Boolean logic, developed by mathematician George Boole, is another critical aspect of computer science, providing a framework for reasoning about true and false values. It employs logical operators such as AND, OR, and NOT to perform operations on binary values, forming the basis for digital circuit design and programming. Together, number systems and Boolean logic enable computers to perform complex calculations and make decisions based on logical conditions..</p>
