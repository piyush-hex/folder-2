   <h1>Chapter 5 – Programming Concepts and Logics</h1>
   <p>Programming concepts and logic form the backbone of software development, enabling programmers to create efficient and effective code. The C programming language, developed in the early 1970s, is one of the most widely used languages due to its efficiency, portability, and powerful features. It provides a structured approach to programming, allowing developers to define data types, control flow, and manage memory effectively. Key concepts in C include variables, data types, operators, control structures (such as loops and conditionals), and functions, which help organize code into reusable components. Understanding these concepts is crucial for developing algorithms and solving problems systematically. C's influence extends beyond its own applications, as it has laid the groundwork for many modern programming languages, making it an essential language for aspiring programmers to learn..</p>
