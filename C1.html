    <h1>Chapter 1 – Computer System</h1>
    <p>A computer system is an integrated assembly of hardware and software components designed to process data and perform a variety of tasks. At its core, a computer system consists of the central processing unit (CPU), memory (RAM), storage devices (like hard drives and SSDs), and input/output devices (such as keyboards, mice, and monitors). The hardware works in conjunction with system software, primarily the operating system, which manages the computer's resources and provides a user interface. Computer systems can vary widely in complexity, from simple embedded systems in household appliances to powerful supercomputers used for scientific research. The evolution of computer systems has led to increased performance, efficiency, and accessibility, making them indispensable tools in modern society.
