    <h1>Chapter 3 – Computer Software & Operating System</h1>
    <p>Computer software refers to the collection of programs and applications that instruct a computer on how to perform specific tasks. It can be categorized into system software, which includes operating systems (OS), and application software, which serves end-user needs. The operating system is a crucial component of any computer system, acting as an intermediary between the user and the hardware. It manages system resources, facilitates file management, and provides a user interface, allowing users to interact with the computer effectively. Popular operating systems include Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux, each offering unique features and capabilities. The development of software has transformed the way we work, communicate, and entertain ourselves, making it an essential aspect of modern technology.</p>
