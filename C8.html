    <h1>Chapter 8 – Information Security and Cyber Law</h1>
    <p>Information security is a critical aspect of protecting data and systems from unauthorized access, breaches, and cyber threats. It encompasses a range of practices, technologies, and policies designed to safeguard sensitive information and ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data. With the rise of digital communication and online transactions, the need for robust security measures has become paramount. Cyber law, on the other hand, refers to the legal frameworks and regulations governing the use of the internet and digital technologies. It addresses issues such as data protection, intellectual property rights, cybercrime, and privacy concerns. Together, information security and cyber law play a vital role in creating a safe and secure digital environment, ensuring that individuals and organizations can operate confidently in the online world.
